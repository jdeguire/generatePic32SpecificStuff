# generatePic32SpecificStuff
An MPLAB X plugin that uses the device database built into MPLAB X to generate device-specific files for PIC32 and SAM devices, such as header files and linker scripts.

If you want to make your own changes to this plugin, be sure to update the licenses in each file with your copyright and update the `GenerateLicenseString()` method in Utils.java so your copyright appears in the generated files.
