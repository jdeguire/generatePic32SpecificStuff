This project is available under the BSD 3-clause license.  I don't know much about licenses and that one seemed good, I guess.

If you want to make your own changes to this plugin, be sure to update the licenses in each file with your copyright and update the `GenerateLicenseString()` method in Utils.java so your copyright appears in the generated files.
